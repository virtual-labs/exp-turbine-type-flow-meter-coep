    <p> Here certain steps are required to be carried out. These steps are termed as”.<br>
        Configuration", "Characterisation”, “Working", "Calibration", and "fault finding".<br> 
        In each phase the user is supposed to carry out certain tasks as per industry standard.<br> 
 </p>
 
    <p style="color:tomato;">1.   Configuration: </p>   
	<p>  To configure a Turbine flow meter you need to select fluid type , material type of blade,<br>
          blade shape, pipe size, no of blades, time in seconds and meter constant value.
 
		</ol>
	 </p>
	 <p style="color:tomato;">2.    Characterisation: </p>   
	<p>  Once the configuration of Turbine flow meter is completed, select VFD speed of flow and start the pump, <br>here the process is completed. 
          Observe the readings of turbine flow meter, magnetic flow meter and WT weight. Also ensure that you take 10 readings with min and max speed of VFD.

 
		</ol>
	 </p>
	 
	 <p style="color:tomato;">3.    Working: </p>   
	<p>  Once the configuration is done, the working of the Turbine flow meter is shown. It shows the number of pulses generated in units
